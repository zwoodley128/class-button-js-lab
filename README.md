\# Classy Buttons!

## Your task today is to go the through the following challenges below and practice some high level class changes. 

### We're applying our lightbulb deliverable knowledge here except all our html and CSS (most of it at least) is built out... you're welcome.

## To be as best prepared as possible for the task ahead, double click each file inside this folder to open them as tabs above. 

## Next, click on your index.html tab above to see your html file, and above the tabs, you'll notice a green button with the word Run next to it

## Click on that run button, a tab where your terminal ususally is, should have opened with a message about Apache having started followed by a link. 

## All your markup output should be visible.

## Next, on the page of your button output, right click to reveal a window, and click on Inspect. A window should appear near your buttons. 

## You'll notice that the word "Element" is underlined. Next to it, is Console, click on it. This is where we'll be triggering and checking for most of our JS code. 

## Now click on the buttons to the left to see which one fires a message. If you figure it out, then you're ready for/almost done with Challenge 1. 

## Sidenote pro-tip: C9 doesn't auto save unless you run it again (this is annoying). So to avoid having to repeat the above steps, use "Command S" or "Ctrl S" (if on a chromebook) to save your work. Then refresh your output page to see reflected changes

### Challenge 1: Are you listening?

The linked JS file currently prints a variation of the "button clicked" message every time you press one of the five buttons.
Code event listeners for the other five buttons and make sure they all work. 

### Challenge 2: Add a class

Now that each button responds, make it so that when you click on a button, it adds the proper class to the target div (the big div that says "Lit!"). 

### Challenge 3: On / Off classes

If you used the classList.add("classname") method, your buttons can turn these styles on, but they can't turn them off. Using if-else statements, or the classList.toggle("classname") functionality, make it so that the buttons can turn styles on OR off. 

### Challenge 4: Your own class!

You'll notice the last button doesn't have any specifications. You get to decide the NAME of this class, and the styling that it applies. You'll need to modify the CSS file AND the javascript file. 

### Congratulations on being done! You did great, now it's time to save those changes and push them to Github. 
### Use the following commands to push to github (Order matters)
## Make sure you're in Terminal, use pwd to see which folder you're in, you should be in the "class-button-js-lab folder"
## git init
## git add . 
## git status
## git commit -m "Write what changes you made to your file"
## git remote add origin "the url you used to clone the repo" (if you get a fatal error then don't worry)
## git push -u origin master 
## Here you'll be prompted for your username and password NOTE** For your password it'll appear as if your not typing anything but you are, it's just not moving the cursor
## Now then, if done successfully, refresh your repostory page and you should see the cahnges you made reflected. 
## Drop a private comment in Google Classroom with the link to the repo. You're done with this part.
